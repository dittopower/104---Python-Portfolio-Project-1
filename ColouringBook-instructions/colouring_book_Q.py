#-----Task Description-----------------------------------------------#
#
#  COLOURING BOOK
#
#  In this task you create a children's colouring game in which
#  given pictures can be coloured by tracing around a shape and
#  then filling it. The controls are as follows.
#
#  ARROW KEYS - Move the "brush" (turtle cursor) left, right, up
#               or down by a fixed small amount.
#
#  'z' - Undo the last step.
#
#  'r', 'g', 'b' - Change the brush colour to red, green or blue,
#                  respectively.  (You can define more colours if
#                  you like, but we expect at least these three.)
#
#  SPACE BAR - Toggle the painting mode.  In "move" mode, which is
#              the initial mode, the "brush" (turtle) moves around
#              the screen without drawing.  In "paint" mode the
#              brush leaves a coloured line as it moves.  Most
#              importantly, when the mode is changed from "paint"
#              to "move", the area traced out by the brush is
#              filled with colour.
